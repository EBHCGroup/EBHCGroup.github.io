		<h2>Get Trained</h2>
		<p>Spreading the high quality medicine world-wide</p>
	</aside>
	<p>Evidence-based healthcare is the standard for the practice of contemporary, high-quality medicine throughout the world. U.S. healthcare schools, including medicine, dentistry and allied healthcare professionals, all offer a curriculum in EBHC. Some recent changes in the U.S. healthcare education standards now require healthcare education programs to offer an EBHC curriculum, a change that has accelerated interest in program and curriculum development in this area. Having an effective and comprehensive teaching program in EBHC is becoming the standard in all healthcare education programs worldwide, much as it has become in medicine over the last decade.</p>
	<p>The EBHC Group offers customized training programs to help members of healthcare organizations, including educational institutions, develop a greater understanding of the EBHC. These programs provide the skill development needed to successfully and efficiently implement EBHC. They also provide a basis of skills needed to teach EBHC to faculty, residents and students. Training programs are typically 2-5 days or more, and are customized to the individual school's specific needs.</p>
